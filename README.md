Hello I am Jonathan Woods! 

I've spent the last couple years working on mobile applications specifically in Xamarin and I am starting to look into MAUI. 
In addition I have built full SQL databases with APIs and some ASP.NET web application for reporting. Knowing all aspects of projects is where I feel most comfortable.

Hopefully you find some good information here!
